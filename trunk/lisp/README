unicad --- Universal Charset Auto Detector for Emacs    -*-outline-*-
====================================================

* Introduction, Overview
========================

  Unicad is short for Universal Charset Auto Detector. It is an
  Emacs-Lisp port of Mozilla Universal Charset Detector.

  Unicad helps Emacs to guess the correct coding system when opening a
  file. It's designed to work automatically and quietly without user
  interaction.

  Following languages and coding systems are supported by unicad:

  * Chinese Simplified  (gb18030, gbk, gb2312, hz-gb-2312, iso-2022-cn)
  * Chinese Triditional (big5, gb18030, gbk, euc-tw)
  * Japanese (sjis, euc-jp, iso-2022-jp)
  * Korean (euc-kr, iso-2022-kr)
  * Unicode (utf-16le, utf-16be with/without signature)
  * Greek (iso-8859-7, windows-1253)
  * Russian (iso-8859-5, windows-1251, koi8-r, ibm855)
  * Bulgarian (iso-8859-5, windows-1251)
  * Western European (latin-1)
  * Central European (latin-2)

* Requirements
==============

  Unicad has been tested on Emacs22.1 and Emacs23 (CVS branch
  emacs-unicode-2) under Ubuntu 7.04 and Windows XP.

* Installation
==============

  You need to put the unicad.el in a directory in your load-path. For
  example, if you put all those files into ~/elisp/, then in your
  ~/.emacs, you should do:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/")
    (require 'unicad nil t)

** Compilation
--------------

  To speed up the charset detecting process, you can byte-compile
  unicad.el.

1a. Byte Compile within Emacs

  In Emacs, type M-x byte-compile-file and the path to unicad.el.

1b. Byte Compile outside Emacs

  In terminal, type 'emacs -q -batch -f bach-byte-compile path/to/unicad.el'
  (without single quote).

* UPDATES
=========

  Unicad project is hosted on Google Code. The latest version can be
  found at <http://code.google.com/p/unicad/>.

* BUG REPORTS
=============

  Any bug reports and suggestions are welcome. Please send me Email:
  <jasonal00 at gmail.com>. It is strongly recommended to attach the
  unrecognized or incorrectly detected files and tell me what
  languages and coding systems the files should use, since I only
  understand English, German and Chinese.

Long live Emacs.
